        </h2>
        <p>
          Just two hours northwest of Toronto, Blue Mountain is a haven of relaxation and 
          rejuvenation surrounded by spectacular natural beauty. No matter the weather, there 
          are things to do and family fun to be had right outside your door.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are all grateful to the Canadian First Nations, <strong>Matis</strong>, 
          and Inuit peoples, who have been the land's stewards and storytellers for millennia.
          We have the privilege of sharing Blue Mountain's beauty with others and are accountable 
          for preserving it for future generations.
